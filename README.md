## Project Information
The chiller data (FreezerData.csv) contains column variables _time, flow, temp and kWE_ (Kilowatt-electric). The _kWR_ is the kilowatts of refrigeration and the _COP_ is the coefficient of performance. These variables were calculated and joined to the dataset. This is a simple data cleaning and analysis with **basic analysis descriptions** of the findings.
